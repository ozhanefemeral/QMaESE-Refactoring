# Code Refactoring Experiment on

## Introduction

Welcome! In this session, you'll be reviewing and improving an existing Python codebase that represents various geometric shapes in 2D and 3D space. The goal is to identify and address code smells, improve code readability, and extend the functionality of the existing code.

## What Awaits You

### Code Smells and Issues

The provided code has intentional code smells and issues for you to discover and fix. These may include:

- **Redundant Code:** Look for repetitive or unnecessary code blocks that can be simplified.
- **Naming Conventions:** Check for inconsistent or unclear variable and method names.
- **Error Handling:** Evaluate the effectiveness of error messages and handling mechanisms.
- **Code Duplication:** Identify duplicated code and suggest ways to refactor for better maintainability.
- **Comments:** Assess the clarity and usefulness of comments. Are they providing meaningful insights?

### Task Overview
